// Recursion in C

/* Recursion = process wich comes into existence when a function calls a copy of itself 
                to work on a smaller problem */

/* Any function wich calls itself is called recursive function and the calls=recursive calls */

// it is important to impose a termination condition
// generaly, iterative solution are more efficient than recursion
// problems suited to be solved by recursion : tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci , factorial
